Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me -- Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me -- -- It feels good!"

        "lyric" : "So we meet again and I offer my hand-- All dry and English slow-- And you look at me and I understand-- Yeah it's a look I used to know-- Three long years and your favorite man-- Is that any way to say hello-- And you hold me like you'll never let me go-- -- Oh c'mon and and have a drink with me-- Sit down and talk a while-- Oh I wish I could and I will-- But now I just don't have the time-- And over my shoulder as I walk away-- I see you give that look goodbye-- I still see that look in your eye-- -- So dizzy Mr Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy-- All the silly frilly things have to first get done-- In a minute sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June-- Until later doesn't always come-- -- It's so hard to think It ends sometime-- And this could be the last-- I should really hear you sing again-- And I should really watch you dance-- Because it's hard to think-- I'll never get another chance-- To hold you to hold you-- -- But chilly Mr Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy-- All the tizzy fizzy idiot things must get done-- In a second, just hang on, all in good time, won't be long-- Until later-- -- I should've stopped to think, I should've made the time-- I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while-- I would've done it right, I would've moved us on-- But I didn't, now it's all too late-- It's over, over-- And you're gone-- -- I miss you, I miss you, I miss you-- I miss you, I miss you, I miss you so much-- -- But how how many times can I walk away and wish If only-- But how many times can I talk this way and wish If only-- Keep on making the same mistake-- Keep on aching the same heartbreak-- I wish If only-- -- But If only-- Is a wish too late"
